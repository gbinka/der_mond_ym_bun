Marging maps
While marging one map part into another you have to:
1. Add value of height parameter and height parameter of all layers
2. Join data from data field to the beggining of existing data field
3. Add nextobjectid of existing part to all new objects and increese existing nextobjectid by new nextobjectid
4. Increase "y" coordinate value of all existing objects by multiple of height and tileheight of new layer (tileheight should be the same in all parts)
5. Add objects from objects layers of added part, to existing object layers
